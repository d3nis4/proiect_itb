# TokenBridge

TokenBridge is a blockchain interoperability project that enables seamless transfer of IBT tokens between the Ethereum and Sui networks. The project consists of two smart contractsâ€”one deployed on Ethereum and one on Suiâ€”that facilitate the minting and burning of IBT tokens. Users can interact with the bridge via a web application, where they authenticate using MetaMask (Ethereum) or SUI Wallet (Sui) to initiate cross-chain transfers.

When a user bridges tokens, they are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain, ensuring a secure, trustless, and decentralized transfer process.

## Features
ðŸŒ‰ Cross-Chain Token Transfers: Transfer IBT tokens between Ethereum and Sui networks.

ðŸ”’ Secure and Trustless: Tokens are burned on the source chain and minted on the destination chain, ensuring data integrity.

ðŸ¦Š MetaMask Authentication: Ethereum users can authenticate using MetaMask.

ðŸ¦„ SUI Wallet Authentication: Sui users can authenticate using the SUI Wallet.

ðŸ”„ Smooth User Experience: Simple, intuitive web interface for token bridging.

## Architecture
### Smart Contracts:

One smart contract deployed on Ethereum to mint and burn IBT tokens.

One smart contract deployed on Sui to mint and burn IBT tokens.

### Web Application:

Users can connect their wallets.

Interface for initiating cross-chain transfers of IBT tokens.

### Security & Trustlessness:

Burn: IBT tokens are burned on the source chain.

Mint: IBT tokens are minted on the destination chain.

## Technologies Used

### Blockchain
Ethereum: For the Ethereum-based smart contract and network.

Sui: For the Sui-based smart contract and network.

### Smart Contracts
Solidity (Ethereum)

Move (Sui)

### Web Application

React.js: Frontend for the web application.

Web3.js: Ethereum Web3 library for interacting with MetaMask.

SUI SDK: Sui SDK for interacting with the SUI Wallet.

### Wallet Integration
MetaMask: For Ethereum-based authentication and interaction.

SUI Wallet: For Sui-based authentication and interaction.

### How It Works
User Authentication:

The user connects their wallet (MetaMask for Ethereum or SUI Wallet for Sui).

Bridge Tokens:

The user selects the amount of IBT tokens they wish to bridge and chooses the source and destination chain (Ethereum or Sui).
Token Burn and Mint:

The IBT tokens are burned on the source chain.
The equivalent amount of IBT tokens is minted on the destination chain.
